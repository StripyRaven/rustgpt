# RustGPT 🦀✨

Welcome to the RustGPT repository! Here, you'll find an innovative web ChatGPT clone entirely crafted using Rust and HTMX, where cutting-edge technology meets simplicity and performance. 🚀

## Introduction

RustGPT is the culmination of my latest experiment in cloning the abilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It represents the fourth iteration in a series of clones, each built with different tech stacks to evaluate their functionality in creating a ChatGPT-like application.

In this repository, you will find a Rust-based server leveraging the Axum framework combined with HTMX, providing a Rusty web development experience. From database operations to streaming responses, this project covers a broad spectrum of backend functionalities and real-time web interactions.

So, for Rust enthusiasts and web developers alike, dive in to explore a world where web development is redefined with the power of Rust!

## Features 🌟

- **Rust with Axum Framework**: A fast and reliable server that's all about performance and simplicity.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight yet powerful database for all your data persistence needs.
- **Server Sent Events (SSE)**: Real-time streaming made easy to bring life to the ChatGPT interactions.
- **HTMX**: No hefty JavaScript frameworks needed—HTMX keeps interactions snappy with simple HTML attributes.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- [`sqlx`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx): Direct and type-safe SQL queries and migrations.
- [`tera`](https://github.com/Keats/tera): A templating engine inspired by Jinja2, for rendering the HTML views.
- [`axum`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum): A web application framework that's easy to use and incredibly fast.

For those eyeing some client-side WASM magic, you might also want to check out [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) or [Leptos](https://github.com/LeptosProject/leptos) for more complex applications.
