# Building RustGPT: My Journey Creating a ChatGPT Clone with Rust, Axum, HTMX, and Tailwind

Welcome to the technical deep-dive of RustGPT, my personal project, which is a clone of the popular ChatGPT, built with
a tech stack that includes Rust, the Axum web framework, HTMX for dynamic interactions, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
This article will walk you through the project, explaining the choices behind the tech stack I chose and the benefits
they have brought.

### Introduction to RustGPT

RustGPT is a text-based chatbot that mirrors the functionality of ChatGPT. Unlike the original, RustGPT is constructed
with a focus on speed and efficiency, using Rust for its excellent performance and Axum for its simplicity in web
framework design.

### Why I Chose Rust and Axum

I turned to Rust because of its renowned execution speed and memory safety. Axum, being an expressive web framework in
Rust, offered me the concurrency and robustness needed for a chat application like RustGPT.

Combining Rust with Axum gave RustGPT the ability to manage numerous chat sessions smoothly, ensuring scalability and
stability even under load.

### The Role of HTMX and Tera Templates

HTMX has been a game-changer for adding interactive features without custom JavaScript, allowing features such as live
updates to the chat interface with minimal effort.

Tera, reminiscent of Jinja2, has made rendering HTML on the server side easy and maintainable. It's been instrumental in
dynamically generating content based on user interactions.

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

For RustGPT, Tailwind CSS has offered a way to implement custom designs quickly, thanks to its utility-first approach.
This meant that I could focus more on functionality without getting bogged down by CSS complexities.

### The Development Process

Creating RustGPT has been a remarkable experience in minimalist and efficient web development. Here are some highlights:

- **Efficient and Lightweight**: The Rust and Axum combination has ensured that RustGPT responds quickly, maintaining a
lightweight footprint.
- **No Need for JavaScript Frameworks**: With HTMX, I avoided the complexity of frameworks like React or Vue, which
typically add weight to the application.
- **Simple and Elegant UI**: Tailwind CSS allowed me to craft a user-friendly interface directly within the HTML.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Rust's type system and Axum's design have made development and maintenance a much
more pleasant experience.

### Looking Ahead

I have big plans for RustGPT, including user account features, improved state management, and even more interactive
elements, all while keeping the application's core simple and efficient.

### Conclusion

RustGPT is a proof of concept for the capabilities of modern web development tools, embodying speed, simplicity, and
safety, without compromising on user experience. As the landscape of web development continues to grow, I believe that
RustGPT and similar projects will demonstrate the full potential of these emerging technologies.
